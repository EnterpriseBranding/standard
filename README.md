# A privacy standard for WordPress plugins

In this repository you will be able to follow the [GDPR WP](https://www.gdprwp.com/) project and collaborate on the development.

Our current proposed standard revolves around a PHP object interface that plugins can implement in their codebase. By implementing this standardized interface, you can tell the world how your plugin works with personal and sensitive data. Implementing the interface will also allow others to build tools that can help make your plugin GDPR compliant. With a standardized implementation, tools can be built that works across all WordPress plugins. That's our goal at least.
